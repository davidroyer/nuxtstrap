# Site Data

> Tips of using `YAML` and `JSON` to seperate out data from our code.

While this can be done in a `JSON` file when i've seen more of, I prefer to use
YAML because of how clean and easy it write and read it is.

By using `js-yaml-loader`, it gets imported as JS which is exactly how JSON is
imported by Webpack.

There are menu use cases and this is just one of them show here below.

## Example

**`db/site.yaml`**

```yaml
nav:
  - title: Home
    path: /

  - title: About
    path: /about

  - title: Contact
    path: /contact
```

**`nuxt.config.js`**

```js
export default {
  build: {
    extend(config, ctx) {
      config.module.rules.push({
        test: /\.ya?ml$/,
        use: 'js-yaml-loader'
      })
    }
  }
}
```

**`store/index.js`**

```js
import siteData from '@/db/site.yml'

export const state = () => ({
  nav: siteData.nav
})
```
